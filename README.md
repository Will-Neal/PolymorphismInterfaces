## Description 

303.6.3 Practice Assignment - Polymorphism and Interface

Scenario: A library needs to develop an online application for two types of users/roles, Adults and children. Both of these users should be able to register an account. Any user under 12 years of age will be registered as a child, and they can borrow a “Kids” category book for 10 days, whereas an adult can borrow “Fiction” category books, which need to be returned within 7 days. 
Note: In the future, more users/roles might be added to the library where similar rules will be enforced. 
Develop interfaces and classes for the categories mentioned above.
